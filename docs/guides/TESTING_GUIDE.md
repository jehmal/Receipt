## üîç Detailed Testing Steps

### Backend API Testing

#### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "message": "Receipt Vault API with WorkOS Auth is running!",
  "auth": "WorkOS AuthKit"
}
```

#### 2. Demo Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/demo
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to Receipt Vault API with WorkOS Authentication!",
  "features": [...],
  "authMethods": [...],
  "status": "Production Ready with WorkOS"
}
```

#### 3. Protected Endpoint (should fail without auth)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/receipts
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

### Authentication Flow Testing

#### Web Authentication
1. **Navigate to login:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/login
   ```
   Should redirect to WorkOS login page

2. **Complete authentication:**
   - Enter email/password or use OAuth
   - Should redirect back to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

3. **Test authenticated endpoint:**
   After login, visit http://localhost:3000/api/receipts
   Should return receipts data

4. **Test user info:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/me
   ```
   Should return user data

5. **Test logout:**
   POST to http://localhost:3000/auth/logout
   Should clear session

#### Mobile Authentication
1. **App Launch:**
   - Should show login screen if not authenticated
   - Should show main app if already authenticated

2. **Login Process:**
   - Tap "Sign in with WorkOS"
   - Browser should open with WorkOS login
   - Complete authentication in browser
   - Return to app

3. **Check Authentication:**
   - Tap "Check Authentication Status"
   - If successful, should navigate to main app
   - If failed, should show error message

4. **App Navigation:**
   - Should access protected screens when authenticated
   - Should redirect to login when not authenticated

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Backend Won't Start
**Error:** `WORKOS_API_KEY is undefined`

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
2. Verify WorkOS credentials are set:
   ```env
   WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
   WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_your_id_here
   ```
3. Restart server

### Issue: Redirect URI Mismatch
**Error:** `Invalid redirect URI`

**Solution:**
1. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` to WorkOS dashboard
2. Ensure exact match (no trailing slash)
3. Check WorkOS project settings

### Issue: Mobile App Can't Connect
**Error:** Network error or connection refused

**Solution:**
1. Ensure backend is running on port 3000
2. Check IP address in mobile service:
   - iOS Simulator: `localhost:3000` ‚úÖ
   - Android Emulator: `10.0.2.2:3000` (might be needed)
3. Test with curl first to ensure backend is accessible

### Issue: Session Errors
**Error:** `Failed to unseal session data`

**Solution:**
1. Generate new `WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD` (32 characters)
2. Clear browser cookies
3. Restart backend server

## üîß Debug Mode Testing

### Enable Debug Logging
Add to `.env`:
```env
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### Check Server Logs
Monitor console output for:
- Authentication attempts
- Session creation/destruction
- API call logs
- Error messages

### Check Mobile App Logs
Look for debug prints in Flutter console:
- Auth service calls
- API responses
- Navigation events
- Error messages

## üìä Performance Testing

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:3000/health

# Test multiple concurrent requests
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl http://localhost:3000/health &
done
wait
```

### Response Time Testing
Expected response times:
- Health check: < 50ms
- Login redirect: < 100ms
- Protected endpoints: < 200ms
- User info: < 100ms

## üéØ Production Testing

Before deploying to production:

1. **Update environment variables** for production
2. **Test with production WorkOS project**
3. **Verify HTTPS/SSL configuration**
4. **Test with real domain names**
5. **Performance test with expected load**
6. **Security audit authentication flow**

## üìû Need Help?

If tests are failing:

1. **Check the logs** - both backend console and mobile app console
2. **Verify configuration** - especially WorkOS credentials and redirect URIs
3. **Test step by step** - start with backend health check, then build up
4. **Compare with working examples** - check the web dashboard flow first
5. **Review the setup guide** - ensure all steps were completed

**Common Commands for Debugging:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check WorkOS configuration
echo $WORKOS_API_KEY  # Should not be empty

# Test mobile app build
cd mobile && flutter doctor

# Check mobile dependencies
flutter pub deps
```

**Happy Testing! üöÄ**
