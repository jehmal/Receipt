# Combined MCP workflow
claude -p "Using all available MCP servers:
1. Analyze Receipt app structure (filesystem)
2. Check database performance (Supabase) 
3. Create UI mockups for new features (Canva)
4. Set up automated tests (Playwright)
5. Maintain project context (Context7)"
```

# Get details about specific server
claude mcp get filesystem
claude mcp get supabase
```

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting MCP Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### 1. Permission Denied Errors
```bash
# Grant permissions when prompted
# MCP servers require explicit permission approval for security

# Check current permissions
claude config get mcp-permissions
```

#### 2. Server Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify NPX packages are accessible
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem --help

# Check network connectivity for cloud-based MCPs
curl -I https://api.supabase.com
```

#### 3. Path Issues (Windows/WSL)
```bash
# Ensure paths are correctly formatted for your environment
# Windows: C:\\Users\\jehma\\Desktop
# WSL: /mnt/c/Users/jehma/Desktop
```

#### 4. Authentication Issues
```bash
# Verify Supabase token is valid
# Check Context7 configuration
# Ensure Canva CLI is properly authenticated
```

## üéØ Best Practices for MCP Usage

### 1. Security Considerations
- Review and approve MCP permissions carefully
- Keep access tokens secure and rotated
- Limit MCP server access to necessary directories only
- Monitor MCP server logs for suspicious activity

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Use specific MCP servers for specific tasks
- Avoid unnecessary cross-server operations
- Cache frequently accessed data when possible
- Monitor resource usage of MCP servers

### 3. Development Workflow Integration
```bash
# Morning development setup with MCP
claude -p "Start development session using all MCP servers:
1. Check project status (filesystem)
2. Verify database health (Supabase)
3. Load previous context (Context7)
4. Prepare testing environment (Playwright)"

# End-of-day workflow
claude -p "End development session:
1. Save current context (Context7)
2. Backup important files (filesystem)
3. Update database if needed (Supabase)
4. Generate daily report (Canva)"
```

## üöÄ Power User Tips

- Design mockup (Canva) ‚Üí 
- Implementation (filesystem) ‚Üí 
- Database changes (Supabase) ‚Üí 
- Automated tests (Playwright) ‚Üí 
- Document decisions (Context7)"
```

### 2. Context-Aware Development
